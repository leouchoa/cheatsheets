# Display Property

Display types:

- `inline`: no widght, no height. Displays an element as an inline element
(like `<span>`). This is default.
- `inline-block`: Displays an element as an inline-level block container.
The element itself is formatted as an inline element,
but you can apply height and width values.
- `block`: Displays an element as a block element (like `<p>`).
It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width
- `none`: The element is completely removed.
