# CSS

## Important Tips

1. At the highest level CSS Grid excels at creating layouts for a webpage, while
Flexbox is a master of content flow for each element that makes up the page layout.

2. When design for mobile, **always** start with the smallest
setting. Which, in code, would translate to putting your `min-width` media
queries at the bottom.

3. On Type Selectors:

- Avoid qualifying ID and class names with type selectors.
- Unless necessary (for example, with helper classes), do not use element
  names in conjunction with IDs or classes. Avoiding unnecessary ancestor
  selectors is useful for performance reasons.
- It is also considered bad practice to use IDs in your CSS files. There are
  no situations where IDs provide a benefit over classes. If you need to use a
  unique name for an element, use a class. (The only benefit IDs provide is
  speed, and is only beneficial on pages with thousands of similar elements.)
