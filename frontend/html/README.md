## Block Elements vs Inline Elements

In HTML, youâ€™ll mainly come across 2 types of HTML elements.

Block elements are meant to structure the main parts of your page,
by dividing your content in coherent blocks.

Block elements are:

```html
    paragraphs <p>
    lists:
        unordered (with bullet points) <ul>, or
        ordered - lists (with numbers) <ol>
    headings: from 1st level <h1> to 6th level headings - <h6>
    articles <article>
    sections <section>
    long quotes <blockquote>
```

Inline elements are meant to differentiate part of a text, to give
it a particular function or meaning. Inline elements usually
comprise a single or few words.

Inline elements are:

```html
    links <a>
    emphasized words <em>
    important words <strong>
```
