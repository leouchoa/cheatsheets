# Common/Useful Patterns

## Goroutines Kinda Like a Closure

You can have a goroutine kinda like a closure:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func writeEvery(msg string, seconds time.Duration) <-chan string {
    messages := make(chan string)
    go func() {
        for {
            time.Sleep(seconds)
            messages <- msg
        }
    }()
    return messages
}

func main() {
    messagesFromA := writeEvery("Tick", 1 * time.Second)
    messagesFromB := writeEvery("Tock", 3 * time.Second)
    for {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-messagesFromA:
            fmt.Println(msg1)
        case msg2 := <-messagesFromB:
            fmt.Println(msg2)
        }
    }
}
```

The `writeEvery` function returns the channel immediately, but the closure
continues in the background.

Also note that the variables inside the closure are not copied into the goroutine,
theyâ€™re only referenced. Since these variables are not modified in the loop,
it's safe. However if they were mutable and shared across goroutines, you need
to watch out for race conditions.

This pattern is something like "Will do something else meanwhile. Here's
my phone number (the channel) so that you can call me to see if it's ready."

## 1. Fan-Out / Fan-In

- **Fan-Out**: Launch multiple goroutines to process jobs in parallel.
- **Fan-In**: Merge results from multiple goroutines into a single channel.

This pattern is useful for parallel processing and increasing throughput.

```go
func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        results <- j * 2 // simulate work
    }
}
```

## 2. Using close() to Signal Completion

- Use close(ch) to tell receivers there will be no more data.
- Receivers use for v := range ch to read until closed.

```go
go func() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
}()

```

## 3. Result Collection via Channels

A goroutine can send a result to a channel, and another goroutine or the
main function can receive it.

```go
func compute(x int, ch chan<- int) {
    ch <- x * x
}
```

## 4. Timeouts with `select` and `time.After`

Useful to avoid deadlocks or long waits.

```go
select {
case res := <-ch:
    fmt.Println("Got:", res)
case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
    fmt.Println("Timeout!")
}
```

## 5. Cancellation with a Done Channel

Using a done channel to signal goroutines to exit early helps in cleaning
long-running or background goroutines when no longer needed.

```go
done := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-done:
            return // exit goroutine
        default:
            // continue doing work
        }
    }
}()
```

## 6. Pipeline Pattern

Chain goroutines where each stage passes data to the next via channels.

```go
// stage 1
nums := make(chan int)
go func() {
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        nums <- i
    }
    close(nums)
}()

// stage 2
squares := make(chan int)
go func() {
    for n := range nums {
        squares <- n * n
    }
    close(squares)
}()
```
