# Node Affinity

To set Node Affinity to the deployment to place the pods on `node01` only.
Update the deployment by running `k edit deployment blue` and add the
`nodeaffinity` section as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: color
                operator: In
                values:
                - blue
```

To create a new deployment named red with the `nginx` image and 2 replicas, and
ensure it gets placed on the `controlplane` node only.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: red
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
                operator: Exists
```
