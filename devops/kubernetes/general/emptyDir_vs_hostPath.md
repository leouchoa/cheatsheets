# Key Differences

1. **Scope and Lifecycle**:
   - `emptyDir` is tied to the lifecycle of the Pod. Once the Pod is terminated,
   the data inside the `emptyDir` is lost.
   - `hostPath` with `type: DirectoryOrCreate` persists as long as the directory
   on the host exists. It survives Pod restarts, but the data is still on the
   node's filesystem.

2. **Use Case**:
   - `emptyDir` is typically used for temporary data storage, often for sharing
   data between containers in a Pod.
   - `hostPath` with `type: DirectoryOrCreate` is used when you need to access
   or store data persistently on the node itself (or create a directory on the
   node if it doesn't already exist).

3. **Management**:
   - With `emptyDir`, Kubernetes automatically handles the storage location and
   its lifecycle.
   - With `hostPath`, you specify a path on the node, and the lifecycle is tied
   to the nodeâ€™s filesystem.
