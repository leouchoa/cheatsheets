# Inherited Access Specifiers

Just as access specifiers (i.e. public, protected, and private) define which
class members users can access, the same access modifiers also define which
class members users of a derived classes can access.

- Public inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class
listed after the specifier keep their member access in the derived class.

- Protected inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class
listed after the specifier are protected members of the derived class.

- Private inheritance: the public and protected members of the base class
listed after the specifier are private members of the derived class.
