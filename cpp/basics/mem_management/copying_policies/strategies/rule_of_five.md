# The Rule of Five

States that if you have to write one of the functions listed below then you
should consider implementing all of them with a proper resource management
policy in place. If you forget to implement one or more, the compiler will
usually generate the missing ones (**without a warning**) but the default versions
might not be suitable for the purpose you have in mind. The five functions are:

1. The destructor: Responsible for freeing the resource once the object it
belongs to goes out of scope.

2. The assignment operator: The default assignment operation performs a
member-wise shallow copy, which does not copy the content behind the resource
handle. If a deep copy is needed, it has be implemented by the programmer.

3. The copy constructor: As with the assignment operator, the default copy
constructor performs a shallow copy of the data members. If something else is
needed, the programmer has to implement it accordingly.

4. The move constructor: Because copying objects can be an expensive operation
which involves creating, copying and destroying temporary objects, `rvalue`
references are used to bind to an `rvalue`. Using this mechanism, the move
constructor transfers the ownership of a resource from a (temporary) `rvalue`
object to a permanent `lvalue` object.

5. The move assignment operator: With this operator, ownership of a resource
can be transferred from one object to another. The internal behavior is very
similar to the move constructor.

## Example (Attention!!)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

class MyMovableClass {
private:
  int _size;
  int *_data;

public:
  MyMovableClass(size_t size) // constructor
  {
    _size = size;
    _data = new int[_size];
    std::cout << "CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at " << this
              << " allocated with size = " << _size * sizeof(int) << " bytes"
              << std::endl;
  }

  MyMovableClass(const MyMovableClass &source) // 2 : copy constructor
  {
    _size = source._size;
    _data = new int[_size];
    *_data = *source._data;
    std::cout << "COPYING content of instance " << &source << " to instance "
              << this << std::endl;
  }

  MyMovableClass &
  operator=(const MyMovableClass &source) // 3 : copy assignment operator
  {
    std::cout << "ASSIGNING content of instance " << &source << " to instance "

              << this << std::endl;
    // protection against self-assignment and is standard boilerplate code for
    // the user-defined assignment operator.
    if (this == &source)
      return *this;
    delete[] _data;
    _data = new int[source._size];
    *_data = *source._data;
    _size = source._size;
    return *this;
  }

  MyMovableClass(MyMovableClass &&source) // 4 : move constructor
  {
    std::cout << "MOVING (c’tor) instance " << &source << " to instance "
              << this << std::endl;
    _data = source._data;
    _size = source._size;
    source._data = nullptr;
    source._size = 0;
  }

  MyMovableClass &
  operator=(MyMovableClass &&source) // 5 : move assignment operator
  {
    std::cout << "MOVING (assign) instance " << &source << " to instance "
              << this << std::endl;
    if (this == &source)
      return *this;

    delete[] _data;

    _data = source._data;
    _size = source._size;

    source._data = nullptr;
    source._size = 0;

    return *this;
  }

  ~MyMovableClass() // 1 : destructor
  {
    std::cout << "DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at " << this << std::endl;
    delete[] _data;
  }
};

int main() {
  MyMovableClass obj1(100); // constructor

  obj1 = MyMovableClass(200); // move assignment operator

  MyMovableClass obj2 = MyMovableClass(300); // move constructor

  return 0;
}

```

Which outputs something like:

```bash
CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab98 allocated with size = 400 bytes
CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab88 allocated with size = 800 bytes
MOVING (assign) instance 0x16ceaab88 to instance 0x16ceaab98
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab88
CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab68 allocated with size = 1200 bytes
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab68
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16ceaab98
```

Note the expanding memory usage to copy!

### Final Example

Update the example code with:

```cpp
void useObject(MyMovableClass obj) {
  std::cout << "using object " << &obj << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  MyMovableClass obj1(100); // constructor

  useObject(obj1);

  MyMovableClass obj2 = MyMovableClass(200);
  // transfer ownership of that temporary object to the function scope, which saves 
  // us one expensive deep-copy. 
  useObject(std::move(obj2));

  return 0;
}
```

Which should print something like:

```bash
CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b98 allocated with size = 400 bytes
COPYING content of instance 0x16b9f2b98 to instance 0x16b9f2b88
using object 0x16b9f2b88
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b88
CREATING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b68 allocated with size = 800 bytes
MOVING (c’tor) instance 0x16b9f2b68 to instance 0x16b9f2b58
using object 0x16b9f2b58
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b58
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b68
DELETING instance of MyMovableClass at 0x16b9f2b98
```

To show you the difference between copying and moving dynamics.
